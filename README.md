# DRAFT encoding template

This repository contains an [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) encoding of the Two Sonatinas for Piano ([WoO Anh. 5 No 1](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/51816) and [WoO Anh. 5 No 2](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/51817)) by Ludwig van Beethoven, Breitkopf und Härtel edition, 1862–90. Plates B.160 and B.161. 

**Note: The MEI headers still need to be FRBRized. **

We hope that this repository will eventually serve as an encoding template for wider use within the [TROMPA](https://trompamusic.eu) project. For now, no assurances are made regarding the validity or consistency of this encoding or its structure.
